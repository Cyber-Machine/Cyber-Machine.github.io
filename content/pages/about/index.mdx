Hi, I'm Maaz Karim!

I have a wide range of interests and they are constantly evolving. I have been involved in Web development, Machine learning, Devops, and Artificial Intelligence.

Currently I'm learning Reinforcement learning and Natural Language Processing. 

Feel free to collaborate with me by sending me an email or ping me in Linkedin. I am always interested in connecting with people and learning together.
